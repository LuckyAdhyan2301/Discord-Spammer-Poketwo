Just a miscellaneous collection of things. You may see these in your bedroom, in your office, outside, in the water, in the sky, etc.

Create a scavenger hunt by generating a couple lists of 10 things. Pass out those lists and race your friends to collect all the object on your list. Some list may be way harder than other. It may be necessary to have the player snap a picture where necessary. For example: are you going to bring a sailboat home? Things like shampoo or a cell phone should be presented in person. Otherwise you could get most of your list done with a camera and a trip to Target.
